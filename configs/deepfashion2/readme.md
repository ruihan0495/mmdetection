# Efficient and Better Clothes Segmentation on DeepFashion2
This repositpry contains the code and model configs of my thesis "Efficient and Better Clothes Segmentation on DeepFashion2". The implementation of EfficientNet is borrowed from [SweetyTian](https://github.com/SweetyTian/efficientdet) with pretrained weights by [rwightman](https://github.com/rwightman/gen-efficientnet-pytorch).
## Dataset
The dataset we used in this thesis is [DeepFashion2](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2). If you would like to use the dataset, please contact the authors and they will provide the password to extract the dataset. The format of dataset directory is listed below
* data/
    * DeepFashion2/
        * train/
            * image/
            * annos/
        * deep_val/
            * validation/image/
            * validation/annos/ \

If you want to train on the subsampled data, please run \
`python tools/sampler.py` \
and it will automatically generate the sampled train and validation dataset under `data/DeepFashion2/sample_train` or, with some modifications,  `data/DeepFashion2/sample_val`. Finally, to generate Coco-stype annotations, please check [here](https://github.com/switchablenorms/DeepFashion2/blob/master/evaluation/deepfashion2_to_coco.py) for how to do it.
## Installation
Our implementation is based on the [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) framework and please refer to [here](https://github.com/ruihan0495/mmdetection/blob/master/docs/get_started.md) for installation instructions.
## Single GPU Training
To train our Eff-twf-sepc model, simply run \
 `python tools/train.py configs/deepfashion2/eff-twf-sepc.py` \
To train our Cascade Pointrend model, run \
 `python tools/train.py configs/deepfashion2/cascade_pointrend.py` 
## Single GPU Testing
To evaluate Eff-twf-sepc, run \
`python tools/test.py configs/deepfashion2/eff-twf-sepc.py work_dirs/eff-twf-sepc/epoch_12.pth --eval bbox segm` \
Note that the `work_dirs/....` is the path where you save your trained `pth` files and this is specified in the model config, e.g. see `work_dir` in the model config. If you would like to only evaluate the segmentation mAP, you can instead run \
`python tools/test.py configs/deepfashion2/eff-twf-sepc.py work_dirs/eff-twf-sepc/epoch_12.pth --eval segm` 
## Distributed Training and Testing
Please refer to [here](https://github.com/ruihan0495/mmdetection/tree/master/tools) for the training and testing scripts.
## Inference
The sample code for inference looks like this:
```Python
from mmdet.apis import inference_detector, init_detector, show_result_pyplot
config = 'configs/deepfashion2/eff-twf-sepc.py'
# Setup a checkpoint file to load
checkpoint = 'work_dirs/eff_twf_sepc/epoch_12.pth'
# initialize the detector
eff_twf_sepc = init_detector(config, checkpoint, device='cuda:0')
img_name = .... # Path to the image
result = inference_detector(pointrend, img_name)
show_result_pyplot(pointrend, img_name, result, score_thr=0.4)
```
